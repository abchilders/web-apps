I attempted to implement form validation for Stage 2 of my sell_book function:
refusing to allow form submission if the sale quantity exceeded the quantity
on hand for that ISBN, showing an informative error message.

If successful, the JavaScript would have dynamically queried the quantity 
on hand for the selected ISBN, then refused to allow form submission if the 
user-inputted quantity was greater than that queried quantity on hand. 
However, I was unable to debug the XML query needed for this JavaScript
to function before the deadline. The code that I did write for XML querying
and the accompanying JavaScript have both been submitted.
