				 still buy it on a semi-regular basis. </td>

			<td> Ramone's Harrison </td>

			<td class="rank"> 4 </td>
			<td> They put some form of chili powder in my chai. I know  
				 it's a spicy chai, but the extra heat was unusual. </td>

			<td> Ramone's Old Town </td>
			<td> Eureka </td>
			<td class="rank"> 7.3 </td>
			<td> Came without milk foam, which I liked because they 
				 could fill my cup to the brim with liquid. I feel like 
				 I got my money's worth, and it was pleasantly aromatic. </td>

			<td> Shotz Coffee </td>
			<td> Fortuna </td>
			<td class="rank"> 7 </td>
			<td> No milk foam, but I could taste the milk (in a good way). 
				 They wrote "hi" on my cup's sleeve. I thought it was cute.
