        ""  ''   // the empty string

============
PREFERRED way to add new elements to the DOM
============
*   see course text, Chapter 9, section 9.3.5, pp. 367-368

*   Table 9.15, p. 368
    "DOM element objects have the following methods for changing
    their children lists"

    *   appendChild(node) - places given node at the END of calling 
        node's child list

    *   insertBefore(new, old) - places new node in calling node's 
        child list JUST before old

    *   removeChild(node) - removes given node from calling node's 
        child list

    *   replaceChild(new, old) - replaces given child of the 
        calling node with the new node

============
NOTE about using JavaScript for form validation
============
*   the form element can have an onsubmit event-handler attribute

    *   as usual, its value is a FUNCTION that is to be called 
        when the submit event happens to that form

    *   interesting additional bit: 
        *   IF this function returns true, the submission is allowed 
            to proceed;

        *   BUT! if this function returns false, 
            it PREVENTS the form submission!
