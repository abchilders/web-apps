Web design guidelines from Chapter 7 to remember: 
1.) Be consistent-- don't vary the names of actions or locations of common 
    options across pages on your website. 
2.) Make your website keyboard-only compatible.
3.) Fonts should be large enough to read comfortably- body text shouldn't be 
    less than 10pt. 

Web design guidelines from "Web Design and Usability" to remember:
1.) Place your name and logo on every page, and make the logo a link to the 
    home page. 
2.) Use hypertext to structure content space into a starting page that provides
    an overview and several secondary pages that each focus on a specific
    topic. 
3.) Test your design with real users.
