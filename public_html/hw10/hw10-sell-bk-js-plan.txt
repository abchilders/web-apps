I will try to use client-side JavaScript to validate user input for quantity of
books to be sold. For instance, I can (carefully) use Javascript to display the 
quantity of books on hand as a placeholder so that the user knows how many 
books can be sold at most. I might also implement an onclick function that 
prevents the user from going to the next stage until the quantity that they 
input is within range, maybe even going so far as to automatically correct 
negative number quantities to 0, or quantities that are too big to the number 
of books on hand.
